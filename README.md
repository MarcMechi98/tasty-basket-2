# Tasty Basket 🛒🍔🥗
Tasty Basket is a full-stack food e-commerce application that I've created from scratch using Angular 16 and SASS for the frontend, and Node.js with MongoDB and Mongoose for the backend. It has several unit tests written in Jasmine in the client side. It includes features such as:
- Home page with several food items
- Food details page
- Cart page
- Checkout page
- User address tracking using Leaflet
- Payment page (using the Paypal SDK)
- Order details page
- All orders page
- Profile page
- Login and registration pages

## Installation
### 1. Clone the project
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MarcMechi98/tasty-basket-2.git

```
### 2. Install client and server dependencies
From the root of the project:
```bash

### 3. Run the project locally
